Air Hockey proof-of-concept using custom velocity-driven tracking optimized for gameplay. Interaction implemented by overriding XR Toolkit MonoBehaviour classes. Hand animations driven by custom [XR Toolkit helpers](https://github.com/nizsanli/unity_xrt_helpers "XR Toolkit Helpers").

Hand models and poses are obtained from [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022 "Oculus Integration"), and the air hockey models (table, pad, and puck) are gathered from the [Free Barcade Asset Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/free-barcade-asset-pack-123704 "Barcade Asset Pack").

##### Controls
* Grip and hold to select
* Right-controller's primary button to reset the puck
